## Python

Python code should pass (through) black and flake8.

Imports should be grouped in the following order:

1. Standard library imports.
2. Related third party imports.
3. Local application/library specific imports.

A blank line should be added between each group of imports.


## Commits

Commit messages should be formatted:

```
parent-module file/object Change message

Longer message if needed to describe change here and url to issue tracker
```

For example

```
db model Add new field for blah

Added new field bla that allows us to do xyz.
```
